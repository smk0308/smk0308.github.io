                <p>The world is in danger. An ancient evil sealed within the core of Faerûn is
                    about to be unveiled. Creatures of mythic proportions roam the lands. Human,
                    dwarven, and elfin lives are at stake. Heroes from all over the world must band
                    together to stop the evil from terrorizing the lands of Faerûn. The cities of
                    Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep hold a relic of power that may help
                    our intrepid heroes to ward off the evil plaguing these lands.
                </p>
                <p>As it stands, all three of the relics of power have been found by the heroes
                    of Faerûn. But, at what costs? Many heroes have fallen. The cities have been
                    razed by the cultists that wish to resurrect the ancient evil.
                </p>
                <p>This campaign is a collaborative effort between three separate campaigns
                    being ran concurrently. The entirety of the campaign is to be completed in one
                    glorious overarching campaign. So far, two of the campaigns have completed their
                    task in gather a relic of power. The last has collected their relic of power,
                    but their party was destroyed in the process. A lone survivor of that party
                    will attempt to join the other campaigns and battle the evil.
