        <h1>Meet The DM</h1>
            <span id="dm-content">
                <p>Hi! My name is Erik and I am the Dungeon Master (DM) for the upcoming campaign. I have been running this
                    campaign for about three years now. I've worked with multiple small campaigns to bring the players
                    together to give some finality to their adventures. This has brought together many players to the campaign
                    and put eyes on excitement and fun on playing some good old Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Being a DM is rewarding and fun. I feel a sense of accomplishment when a group of players completes an
                    objective of a campaign through my story telling and combat scenarios. I get to keep people on their toes
                    with decisions. I will not lie, I do get some chuckles when I get to be evil in my story telling and putting
                    players in precarious situations. It is a lot of fun and I would highly recommend it to any to try and
                    become a DM.
                </p>
                <p>
                        Another side to being a DM is the creation of encounters. I enjoy creating a landscape for the players
                    to move their characters around on and interact with their environment. My story telling gets to let the
                    player be part of the environment.</p>
