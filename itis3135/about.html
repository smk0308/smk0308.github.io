        <p>Our company makes custom-made unique and colorful cat trees for your best furry friend. Want a tree with
            every
            color in the rainbow, or even a monochromatic look? We've got you covered! From platforms in the shapes of
            flowers to clouds, mushrooms, or stars,
            our mission is to make sure that your kitty can have a colorful and cute space to lounge and scratch. We
            make sure that our
            trees are made of all natural eco-friendly materials, so that any debris from scratching is safe for you and
            your clawed friend.
