            <li><b>Personal Background: </b>I was born in Florida, but raised in Ohio.
                Moved here to Charlotte about two years ago. Iâ€™m the youngest of three sisters, with one older brother.
                I like video games and drawing in my free time.
            </li>
            <li><b>Professional Background: </b> Worked at a pet store for a while after I graduated from high school,
                currently working here at UNCC as a TA for 2214 Data Structures.
            </li>
            <li><b>Academic Background: </b>I was homeschooled during middle and highschool, and was a member of the
                NHS. After graduating,
                I did a few online classes during lockdown at WVU. I started here at UNCC in spring of 2023, and have
                been here since!</li>
            <li><b>Background in this Subject: </b>I took a web development class during highschool,
                and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though it was only simple HTML and CSS within notepad, it still
                opened me up to the world of web development.
            </li>
